======

Thank you for coming to our plugin github site!
Without said this plugin has multiple commands and i have provided an SRC of the package for you!
I dont always do this but i think you guys deserve it!
Just to be clear this is all advanced code!
You will not catch on quickly to my version of code!
If you watch all the videos or some of the tutorials on https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnlvtkIDzVY-3tFI-mz30pA
Then you will be catching on quite easily!

PLEASE DO NOT COPY ANY OF THIS CODE FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL PLUGIN!
  THIS PLUGIN IS MADE ON BUKKIT!
    DONT POST ANY REMIXES/VERSIONS WITHOUT PERMISSION!
